Stable Release

**Note:** PyPI updates may lag the actual tagging of the release.

You can find all of the official source and binaries hosted at the `PyPI
project page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas#downloads>`_.

- `Christoph Gohlke <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke>`_  kindly makes available windows binaries for current versions of many python packages, including pandas. See `Here <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pandas>`_.
- Source tarballs are available, immediately upon release, on the `GitHub Releases <https://github.com/pydata/pandas/releases>`_ page for the project.

Development Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stable windows binaries are built on a rotating basis every hour, as long as
there have been code changes on GitHub since the previous build. You can find
the latest builds `here <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-build/dev/>`_.

Development is source controlled using git. Here's a handy guide to `getting started <http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect>`__. If you're interested in contributing to development, please visit our `contributing guidelines <http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/contributing.html>`__.
