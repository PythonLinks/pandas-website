v0.21.1 Final (December 12, 2017)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a minor bug-fix release in the 0.21.x series and includes some
small regression fixes, bug fixes and performance improvements. We
recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

Highlights include:

-  Temporarily restore matplotlib datetime plotting functionality. This
   should resolve issues for users who relied implicitly on pandas to
   plot datetimes with matplotlib. See
   `here <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21.1/whatsnew.html#restore-matplotlib-datetime-converter-registration>`__.
-  Improvements to the Parquet IO functions introduced in 0.21.0. See
   `here <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21.1/whatsnew.html#improvements-to-the-parquet-io-functionality>`__.
