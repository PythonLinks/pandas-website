History of Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2008, *pandas* development began at `AQR Capital Management
<http://www.aqr.com>`_. By the end of 2009 it had been `open sourced
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>`_, and is actively supported today
by `Lambda Foundry <http://www.lambdafoundry.com>`_, a company focused on
building high-performance and high-productivity tools for Finance. Please see
the `commercial support <commercialsupport.html>`_ page for full details.

There is also a community of like-minded individuals around the world who
contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source *pandas*
possible. Thank you to `all of our contributors
<https://github.com/pydata/pandas/contributors>`_.
